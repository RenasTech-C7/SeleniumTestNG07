How do we handle dropdowns using Selenium?

HOW MANY TYPES OF DROPDOWN ARE THERE?

1- Select dropdowns: are created by using <select> tag in HTML

	<select>
		<option value="1"> option1 </option>
		<option value="2"> option2 </option>
		<option value="3"> option3 </option>
	</select>
--use select class to locate them.
by value,index and text

2- HTML dropdowns: these are the dropdowns that are created NOT USING <select>
	- These dropdowns are handled just like any other webElement you will see on the page.
