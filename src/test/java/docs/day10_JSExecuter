-What is hardcoding?
    -harcoding means passing every data inside of class without using any utils or files
	-> if you hard code, to be able to change the test data
	you have to go to each test and change the data from there.

-Data Driven Testing is running the same test against different datas.
	- instead of hardcoding tes data inside of test
	- We created a properties file and we keep our test data in the file.
    --DataProvider Annotation

PropertiesReading utility class
	-> to be able to read from .properties type of file, we created util class.
	-> steps to read from properties file:
		1- Creating the object from Properties class
		Properties properties = new Properties();
		2- We need to OPEN the file in
			FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream("path");
		3- We need to load the file to properties object.
			properties.load(file);
		4- We close the previously opened file
			file.close();
//by hiding properties object and getting this object in the getter method is
basically an example of encapsulation

--> JavaScriptExecutor :
    for some actions that selenium that able to handle

	-JavaScriptExecutor is an Interface that helps to execute JavaScript through Selenium Webdriver.
	-JavaScriptExecutor provides two methods "executescript" & "executeAsyncScript"
	to run javascript on the selected window or current page.
	-This method executes JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window in Selenium.

	JavaScriptExecutor:

	1- We create javascriptExecutor object and we cast our WebDriver type instance into JavascriptExecutor type.
    JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;

    2- Then we have access to the methods that are coming from JavascriptExecutor interface.
    js.executeScript(Script,Arguments);

    For arguments scrooldown , click ,window.open etc..
    -- you will prefer to use when you are not able to do some actions with selenium

Scroll in Selenium?
     -with selenium itself you are not able to scrooll in the page you need :
 	1-JSExecutor
